## IDEAS

- audio test, text to speech. user listens audio of the text and writes it.
- image test, allow user add images and text answer for them.
- sentence test. add sentence and the test will remove one word of it randomly and test it, by letting user write it. add this as extra testing option with name "sentence training". the current one is "word training". with sentence training ad it at bottom of the textareas. it needs two languages as well. so two textareas. in the testing phase. so the other language without one word that user has to input.
- add graph showing how many times you answered each word correctly in the history view. show this also in the results if you have previous history from this to show progress.
