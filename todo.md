## IDEAS

- audio test, text to speech. user listens audio of the text and writes it.

- image test, allow user add images and text answer for them.

- sentence test. add sentence and the test will remove one word of it randomly and test it, by letting user write it. add this as extra testing option with name "sentence training". the current one is "word training". with sentence training ad it at bottom of the textareas. it needs two languages as well. so two textareas. in the testing phase. so the other language without one word that user has to input.

- add drag and drop test. like we have writing test and multiselect. in drag and drop test you have a boxes in table mized around and you need to put them in order, in that way that next to each other is correct answers. for each table row there is two boxes and and two positions.

- add credits page with sources for each asset etc.
