## IDEAS

- audio test, text to speech. user listens audio of the text and writes it.
- image test, allow user add images and text answer for them.
- sentence test. add sentence and the test will remove one word of it randomly and test it, by letting user write it.
- change the settings around: make all the test-options a checkbox (writing test & multiselect), set them all default on. meaning all types of test options are selected.
- dark theme mode for night reading
- focus on input in testing, when the word changes and input is enabled again.
