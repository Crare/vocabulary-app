## IDEAS

- add templates to use for testing
- audio test, text to speech. user listens audio of the text and writes it.
- image test, allow user add images and text answer for them.
- sentence test. add sentence and the test will remove one word of it randomly and test it, by letting user write it.
- in templates, group templates by languages, like "english to finnish", "finnish to swedish", etc. make collapsible by group.
- make the header smaller, make it navbar and add settings in there.
- add in the navbar a page to check previous test-results.
- change the settings around: make all the test-options a checkbox (writing test & multiselect), set them all default on.
