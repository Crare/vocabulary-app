# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Guidance

The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confuson points that agents might encounter as they work in this project. If you ever encounter something in the project that suprises you, please alert the developer working with you and indicate that this is the case in the AgentMD file to help prevent future agents from having the same issue.

For detailed project specs (architecture, services, data models, deployment, testing), see the `.spec/` directory.

All code must be optimized, readable, secure, and testable. Prefer clarity over cleverness, avoid premature abstractions, never hardcode secrets, and ensure new logic can be covered by unit tests.
